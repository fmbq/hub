## What is Quizzing?

Bible Quizzing is a ministry that encourages 6th through 12th grade students to
study and memorize Scripture through competition. Each year a specific portion of
scripture is chosen (1 & 2 Corinthians, John, Romans & James) and quizzers will
study that text in weekly increments throughout the school year. The competition
comes when quizzers are matched with other quizzers to see who can answer the most
questions in a series of 15-question quiz rounds. This is done on a weekly basis
during Quiz practice, monthly at local tournaments, and annually at
Conference/Regional quizzes and Quiz Finals.

Free Methodist Bible Quizzing uses the NIV-2011 translation of the Holy Bible. Our
current season (2021-2022) is over **1&2 Timothy, Titus, Matthew 1-13**.
